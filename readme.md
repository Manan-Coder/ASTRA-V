# ASTRA-V

heyo! Manan this side - this is my second big hardware project after my foldable 3d printer - ASTRA-V. Stands for Autonomous Stabilised Thrust Recovery Ascent Vehicle.

The concept is simple - Go up - attain free fall - thrust again a lil when around 3 feet from the ground - land.

Its using LiDars to calculate the height precisely and they are pretty quick, so no problems.
I am gonna write more on it as rn its 4am while writing this - so see you then.

here is the BOM -
